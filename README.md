# Global Warming
## Problem Statement: Is global warming real and how can we show that it is real?
Global warming is a major reason why the ice caps in Antarctica and also with the annual temperature increase over the years since the 1880s, there is not doubt that global warming is real.
Recent events like the fires in California and also with now two hurricanes hitting the US for the first time in years is also a effect of global warming. 

## Why is this interesting?: This is the future at stake. Mother earth this year has been letting it loose and is showing its power and punishing us for not take care of her for so many years
Many politicians believe this is fake and it is really idiotic that they believe this is fake and not real becuase with the current events going on, it should be clear that it is real.
Our generation is trying to create the change in which mother earth needs and it would be a great help if the older generations see the facts and change their minds to help as well 

## We looked at data of the annual temperature in the world and there is a significant increase over the years since the 1880s
This data really highlights the fact that with many carbon emissions being let out into the earth, the atmosphere really is shrinking and taking off the protection from the atmosphere from the heat and sooner than later, we could have high risks of cancer because of the radiation of the sun
This data is important to show that temperature really has increase a lot and will continue 

## What you learned: 
We learned the significant rise of temperature from the years 1880s to recent day (2020). With the data we were able to gather we concluded that global warming is real and it is a problem the world faces.
